### Recommender systems aim to predict usersâ€™ interests and recommend product items that quite likely are interesting for them.

### Recommendation system will help businesses improve their shopper's,user experience or on website,youtub,amazon and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

### Types of recommendation system

## There are majorly six types of recommender systems which work primarily in the Media and Entertainment industry::

### 1. Popularity based recommendation system
### 2. Content-based recommendation system
### 3. Collaborative recommendation system
### 4. Matrix factorization recommendation system
### 5. Association Rule
### 6. Hybrid-recommendation system

## 1. Popularity based recommendation system

### This model is not actually personalized - it simply recommends to a user the most popular items that the user has not previously consumed i.e. even though you know the behaviour of the user you cannot recommend items accordingly.

## 2. Content-based recommendation system

### This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended..

## 3. Collaborative recommendation system

### Collaborative filtering is currently one of the most frequently used approaches and usually provides better results than content-based recommendations. Some examples of this are found in the recommendation systems of Youtube, Netflix, and Spotify.

 ### Collaborative Filtering, which is also known as User-User Filtering. As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one we will be using here is going to be based on the Pearson Correlation Function.
